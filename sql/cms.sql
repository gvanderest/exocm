It could be you are here because you need help with an existing system. Maybe you know it&rsquo;s time to put in a new network. Or it could be a combination of both. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Not only are we the premier choice for your IT needs, we have the specific experience needed to understand your school&rsquo;s best interests. Our work with the Boys Republic of Chino, Somerset Educational Services, and other local boarding schools has given us the edge needed to serve you. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Security and privacy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You\'re likely aware how important is to protect the personal information of students enrolled<br /> at your institution. We\'re right there with you on that. Work with our experts to lock down<br /> your records with ABSS NetSecure. We do it with sophisticated hardware firewalls that keep malicious content from getting in or out. We do it with patch management on every component in your network. We do it with vulnerability testing and assessment conducted by our experts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Migrate to Mac computer networks </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Apple has long been at the forefront when it comes to computerizing education. If you\'re looking to replace part or all of your Windows-based network with machines that run the Mac OS, you\'re in the right place. Talk to us about network design. Have us assemble a configuration that does exactly what you want it to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Integrate Mac and Windows machines into one efficient network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If administration is running fine on Windows-based PCs and the teachers and students are working away in a separate Mac network, you may think it best to leave well enough alone. The thing is, when you stay this course, you lose efficiency and the ability to communicate with classrooms and monitor their activity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Integrate your networks with help from ABSS.

The amount of time people spend looking at social and pornographic websites is staggering. We\'re willing to bet you have Facebook open in another window or tab right now. Don\'t be surprised if we\'re right. One of every twelve people on the planet has a Facebook account. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Eliminate the tremendous temptation to see what friends are saying and protect your organization from legal action with content filtering. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Data backup and restoration </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Work with us to save every bit of student record data you can.

Most of them relate to the nine listed here. If even one of these applies to you, please contact us today. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You are not in the business of IT. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â—‹ Look at it this way: If your company designs and builds, say, digital cameras, it&rsquo;s unlikely your employees would get involved in replacing the plumbing in your building. You might have a person or two that&rsquo;s handy with a wrench and torch, but in the grand scheme of things, those people are more valuable when they are doing what they were hired to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The same scenario applies to your office network. Your camera people may be technologically inclined, but they are probably best suited to developing new CCDs rather than programming firewalls. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our business is taking care of your network. Put us to work. â—‹ </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">In-house professionals are expensive </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â—‹ Full time IT experts are worth their weight in gold. Yes. We are sounding our own horn here, but we believe in what we do. We give you our best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The thing is, even if you are experiencing major network problems, you probably do not need one of us in your office every hour of every day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your solution is to sign with ABSS for In-Sourced and Managed IT. You&rsquo;ll get all the knowledge and service you need, but only when you actually need it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You&rsquo;ve given IT responsibility to someone that doesn&rsquo;t really want it </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â—‹ We&rsquo;re not talking about a person who doesn&rsquo;t want to work. This is about employees that care about the company and do their best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Every so often, even your most dedicated people will bite off more than they can chew. They may think, as they do with their other responsibilities, that maintaining the network will be a rewarding challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The trouble arises when the challenge goes beyond their abilities. It takes uncommon mental fortitude to swallow and digest the difficult problems. It&rsquo;s not that your person lacks the hunger. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not prepared to consume IT work in the same portions as the job for which they were hired. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Feed us your IT work.

Your employee lacks only the time needed to get everything done. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If It&rsquo;s not time to add a second professional to your staff, the welcomed assistance can come from our In-Sourced IT service. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Technology has advanced beyond the skills of your IT person </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â—‹ Keep your network up-to-date with technology and keep your expert professional on staff. Bring ABSS Computer Networks in as your expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s only natural that as technology marches on, dedicated employees with a full plate of work can have trouble keeping up. There is likely not enough time in the day for them to train and learn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Don&rsquo;t forget that network problems with elusive solutions have a tendency to materialize without warning or reason. For those extra-challenging ones, a second expert can often make for a quicker victory in the ever-lasting battle to maintain a perfect network. Give your IT person the help they need (but only when it&rsquo;s needed) by signing up with ABSS today. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">It&rsquo;s hard to find the IT person you actually need </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â—‹ Here&rsquo;s a tough spot: you&rsquo;re having network problems, you think you need a professional on staff, and, since you are not an IT expert yourself, you do not have a clear idea about which person to hire. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Put ABSS on the job.

After all, if it isn&rsquo;t making crunchy grinding noises, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;likely&rdquo; doing just fine. Banking on &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is similar to rolling the dice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you could see inside, things might look a little clearer (and you won&rsquo;t have to gamble). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our ClearView monitoring lets us do exactly that.

Your employee is top-notch and usually takes any problem and<br /> just handles it. This time, however, the initial response to your request was an expression of excitement that slowly degenerated into abject terror. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your IT experts have not kept up with technology. They&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Of course this scenario is quite a bit better than having an under-qualified, over-confident staff member just diving in and hoping they can swim. It takes training, experience, and life-long learning to avoid drowning in an ocean of routers, cables, switches, and CPUs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">This is another reason we&rsquo;re here &ndash; to be your IT expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe your network slow-down problem stems from too many data collisions.

It&rsquo;s likely those machines won&rsquo;t be one-size-fits-all. We&rsquo;ll use our expertise to build workstations that can do just a bit more than they&rsquo;re supposed to. That way you won&rsquo;t need to upgrade quite so soon. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Configure and install network printers </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Most days it&rsquo;s easy to print. Just put what you want on the screen, and, well, select print. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to add a printer and make it visible to everyone, you might already understand why we offer this service. If there was ever one type of device that hates to play nice, this would be it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Onsite data backup and recovery </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Now that we&rsquo;ve got a network for your data to move about, let us help keep you from losing it. We can configure onsite data storage and automatic backup. Rest assured that if a hard drive fails in spectacular fashion or someone accidentally deletes a file with a whimper, you&rsquo;ll be able to retrieve your latest backup in minutes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Remember that even the best onsite systems can&rsquo;t protect data from disaster. Fires, floods and earthquakes don&rsquo;t seem to discriminate when it comes to destruction of property. Look into our offsite backup service to protect your most sensitive data in secure locations around the globe. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Point-of-failure elimination with redundancy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Seems like no matter what you do, something just breaks without warning. Maybe a power supply gets tired and pops or a hard drive just kinda wheezes and clunks to a halt. Usually our network monitoring service spots an anomaly before it turns into a failure. But every once in a while a machine will just give up the ghost without so much as flicker of notice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks are designed with redundancy in mind. If a critical portion of the network stops working, other machines step in to take up the slack.You&rsquo;ll likely feel it in the form of a slow-down here or there, but our monitoring will tell us immediately that something is up (or down as the case may be).<br /> If you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll know what to bring before you even call for service. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and get a new network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 18:58:55','2012-02-28 18:58:55','2012-02-28 18:58:55'),(45,22,'en','Network Security with ABSS NetSecure','<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 18.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Network Security with ABSS NetSecure </span></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you\'ve been in business long enough, you\'ll likely agree that people will try to hack your network, you know, just because. They&rsquo;ll write programs that target indiscriminately. They&rsquo;ll set up scripts that tirelessly chip away at your passwords. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">One day they&rsquo;ll get through and your data will be compromised.<br /> If you have nothing to hide, intrusions are still disasters waiting to happen.<br /> If you have something to hide, like customer data, intrusions are lawsuits waiting to happen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Hardware Firewalls </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep malicious content from entering or leaving your network. Once it gets in, it often takes hold and starts sending sensitive material out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve got anything worth protecting, running without security has a horrible risk/reward ratio. You are risking everything for a reward of nothing. Turn the tables with one easy step. Add a hardware firewall and lock down your data. Change the ratio so you can risk nothing to keep everything. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call ABSS at ###-###-#### to put your data behind the firewall and keep it safe. It&rsquo;s simple to do and it just makes good sense. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Patch Management </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Updating operating systems, virus protection, and software on one machine is mildly time- consuming at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 342 machines, it&rsquo;s certainly too much for one person to maintain all of them. It&rsquo;s probably too much to expect even 342 people to maintain one machine a piece. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Avoiding lost time by simply not having it often costs more money than it saves. Patches, especially those for operating systems and virus protection, are written to solve security issues. Since some people are constantly finding new ways to break in to your network, other people are constantly working to keep those intruders out. Their work is distributed as a patch. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Sign up for patch management from ABSS NetSecure. Every machine gets kept up-to-date. You avoid lost time because we do all the work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Vulnerability Testing and Assessment </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Threats come from outside and inside your network. Even if you have a firewall and patch management in place, you are constantly visible to intruders. They may not be able to get in at this moment, but they&rsquo;re always looking toward the next. This means it&rsquo;s good practice to test your security at regular intervals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Firewalls only work as well as they&rsquo;re configured. That configuration must be updated to keep up with emerging threats. One update might be a simple change to one setting. But if your administrator allows incomplete updates to stack up, they&rsquo;ll end up with a complicated task in </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">a short period of time. If that administrator is replaced and leaves no documentation, the new person may not even know where to start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Entrust our ABSS NetSecure professionals to test your firewall configuration for vulnerabilities and advise or implement a solution if they are found. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Inside threats are different. They often get placed when someone finds a way to get them through the firewall. Malicious software can sit dormant for days or months and then activate on command. The key to preventing an outbreak throughout the network, or even a little data stream from heading out into the world, is containment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to spot dormant threats (they are often stealthy by design). Fortunately, our tests confirm that when they become active, they won&rsquo;t be allowed to go anywhere. Our efficiency allows us to test every machine on your network while your people continue to work. When a threat comes to life, it will open its eyes to an impenetrable cage. After that, if you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll spot it with ABSS ClearView and take it out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 19:00:40','2012-02-28 19:00:40','2012-02-28 19:00:40'),(46,23,'en','Local Non-Profits','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Local Non-Profits </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;re in charge of handling IT for a non-profit organization, we wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if one or more of the following are true: </span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â— &nbsp;You have an aging or out-dated network </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â— &nbsp;The cost to replace (or even just update) your network is believed to be too high </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â— &nbsp;Operating on the existing network is getting more expensive every day </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">â— &nbsp;An IT disaster would spell, well, disaster. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Fortunately, there is another truth.

Every additional server, workstation, and application made sense at the time. Now you&rsquo;re faced with<br /> a collection of old machines running different operating systems that control outdated software. You&rsquo;d like to update the whole lot at once but the cost to replace every computer with a new one is more than what you can spend. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your solution may lie in consolidation, replacing multiple machines with one. Maybe virtualization at your location will be the best. It could be that using offsite cloud-based computing would make even more sense.

After all, if it isn&rsquo;t making crunchy grinding noises, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;likely&rdquo; doing just fine. Banking on &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is similar to rolling the dice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you could see inside, things might look a little clearer (and you won&rsquo;t have to gamble). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our ClearView monitoring lets us do exactly that. It&rsquo;s a window to the inner workings of your network. With it we can: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Communicate with a secure, invisible connection</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All transmissions to and from your network are encrypted via SSL.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">The monitoring agent uses almost no system resources. You will not see any&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">network slow-downs.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Manage and monitor Servers, Networks and Workstations</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Choose the plan that&rsquo;s right for you.

This time, however, the initial response to your request was an expression of excitement that slowly degenerated into abject terror. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your IT experts have not kept up with technology. They&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Of course this scenario is quite a bit better than having an under-qualified, over-confident staff member just diving in and hoping they can swim. It takes training, experience, and life-long learning to avoid drowning in an ocean of routers, cables, switches, and CPUs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">This is another reason we&rsquo;re here &ndash; to be your IT expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe your network slow-down problem stems from too many data collisions.

It could be you are here because you need help with an existing system. Maybe you know it&rsquo;s time to put in a new network. Or it could be a combination of both. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Not only are we the premier choice for your IT needs, we have the specific experience needed to understand your school&rsquo;s best interests. Our work with the Boys Republic of Chino, Somerset Educational Services, and other local boarding schools has given us the edge needed to serve you. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Security and privacy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You\'re likely aware how important is to protect the personal information of students enrolled&nbsp;at your institution. We\'re right there with you on that. Work with our experts to lock down&nbsp;your records with ABSS NetSecure. We do it with sophisticated hardware firewalls that keep malicious content from getting in or out. We do it with patch management on every component in your network. We do it with vulnerability testing and assessment conducted by our experts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Migrate to Mac computer networks </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Apple has long been at the forefront when it comes to computerizing education. If you\'re looking to replace part or all of your Windows-based network with machines that run the Mac OS, you\'re in the right place. Talk to us about network design. Have us assemble a configuration that does exactly what you want it to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Integrate Mac and Windows machines into one efficient network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If administration is running fine on Windows-based PCs and the teachers and students are working away in a separate Mac network, you may think it best to leave well enough alone. The thing is, when you stay this course, you lose efficiency and the ability to communicate with classrooms and monitor their activity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Integrate your networks with help from ABSS. While we\'re there, we can put content filtering in place.

The amount of time people spend looking at social and pornographic websites is staggering. We\'re willing to bet you have Facebook open in another window or tab right now. Don\'t be surprised if we\'re right. One of every twelve people on the planet has a Facebook account. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Eliminate the tremendous temptation to see what friends are saying and protect your organization from legal action with content filtering. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Data backup and restoration</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Work with us to save every bit of student record data you can.

Most of them relate to the nine listed here. If even one of these applies to you, please contact us today. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You are not in the business of IT. </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Look at it this way: If your company designs and builds, say, digital cameras, it&rsquo;s unlikely your employees would get involved in replacing the plumbing in your building. You might have a person or two that&rsquo;s handy with a wrench and torch, but in the grand scheme of things, those people are more valuable when they are doing what they were hired to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The same scenario applies to your office network. Your camera people may be technologically inclined, but they are probably best suited to developing new CCDs rather than programming firewalls. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our business is taking care of your network. Put us to work.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">In-house professionals are expensive </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Full time IT experts are worth their weight in gold. Yes. We are sounding our own horn here, but we believe in what we do. We give you our best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The thing is, even if you are experiencing major network problems, you probably do not need one of us in your office every hour of every day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your solution is to sign with ABSS for In-Sourced and Managed IT. You&rsquo;ll get all the knowledge and service you need, but only when you actually need it. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You&rsquo;ve given IT responsibility to someone that doesn&rsquo;t really want it </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">We&rsquo;re not talking about a person who doesn&rsquo;t want to work. This is about employees that care about the company and do their best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Every so often, even your most dedicated people will bite off more than they can chew. They may think, as they do with their other responsibilities, that maintaining the network will be a rewarding challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The trouble arises when the challenge goes beyond their abilities. It takes uncommon mental fortitude to swallow and digest the difficult problems. It&rsquo;s not that your person lacks the hunger. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not prepared to consume IT work in the same portions as the job for which they were hired. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Feed us your IT work. We really eat it up..</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Your IT person is overloaded </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Give that person some help from ABSS. They&rsquo;re into what they do and they are great at it. Your employee lacks only the time needed to get everything done. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If It&rsquo;s not time to add a second professional to your staff, the welcomed assistance can come from our In-Sourced IT service. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Technology has advanced beyond the skills of your IT person </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep your network up-to-date with technology and keep your expert professional on staff. Bring ABSS Computer Networks in as your expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s only natural that as technology marches on, dedicated employees with a full plate of work can have trouble keeping up. There is likely not enough time in the day for them to train and learn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Don&rsquo;t forget that network problems with elusive solutions have a tendency to materialize without warning or reason. For those extra-challenging ones, a second expert can often make for a quicker victory in the ever-lasting battle to maintain a perfect network. Give your IT person the help they need (but only when it&rsquo;s needed) by signing up with ABSS today. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">It&rsquo;s hard to find the IT person you actually need </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Here&rsquo;s a tough spot: you&rsquo;re having network problems, you think you need a professional on staff, and, since you are not an IT expert yourself, you do not have a clear idea about which person to hire. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Put ABSS on the job. We&rsquo;ll take care of your computer problems now and help you determine if a full time expert on staff is right for you. We realize that we might be limiting our future involvement with that kind of advice, but our goal is your satisfaction and the peace of mind that only an efficient and smooth-running network can bring. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You are often bringing in a consultant </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Understand that we appreciate loyalty in our field.

Rest assured that if a hard drive fails in spectacular fashion or someone accidentally deletes a file with a whimper, you&rsquo;ll be able to retrieve your latest backup in minutes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Remember that even the best onsite systems can&rsquo;t protect data from disaster.

Look into our offsite backup service to protect your most sensitive data in secure locations around the globe. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Point-of-failure elimination with redundancy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Seems like no matter what you do, something just breaks without warning. Maybe a power supply gets tired and pops or a hard drive just kinda wheezes and clunks to a halt. Usually our network monitoring service spots an anomaly before it turns into a failure.

If a critical portion of the network stops working, other machines step in to take up the slack.You&rsquo;ll likely feel it in the form of a slow-down here or there, but our monitoring will tell us immediately that something is up (or down as the case may be).<br /> If you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll know what to bring before you even call for service. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and get a new network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 19:44:39','2012-02-28 19:44:39','2012-02-28 19:44:39'),(66,23,'en','Local Non-Profits','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Local Non-Profits </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;re in charge of handling IT for a non-profit organization, we wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if one or more of the following are true: </span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">&acirc;ï¿½ï¿½ &nbsp;You have an aging or out-dated network </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">&acirc;ï¿½ï¿½ &nbsp;The cost to replace (or even just update) your network is believed to be too high </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">&acirc;ï¿½ï¿½ &nbsp;Operating on the existing network is getting more expensive every day </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">&acirc;ï¿½ï¿½ &nbsp;An IT disaster would spell, well, disaster. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Fortunately, there is another truth.

They&rsquo;ll write programs that target indiscriminately. They&rsquo;ll set up scripts that tirelessly chip away at your passwords. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">One day they&rsquo;ll get through and your data will be compromised.<br /> If you have nothing to hide, intrusions are still disasters waiting to happen.<br /> If you have something to hide, like customer data, intrusions are lawsuits waiting to happen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Hardware Firewalls </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep malicious content from entering or leaving your network. Once it gets in, it often takes hold and starts sending sensitive material out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve got anything worth protecting, running without security has a horrible risk/reward ratio. You are risking everything for a reward of nothing. Turn the tables with one easy step. Add a hardware firewall and lock down your data. Change the ratio so you can risk nothing to keep everything. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call ABSS at ###-###-#### to put your data behind the firewall and keep it safe. It&rsquo;s simple to do and it just makes good sense. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Patch Management </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Updating operating systems, virus protection, and software on one machine is mildly time- consuming at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 342 machines, it&rsquo;s certainly too much for one person to maintain all of them. It&rsquo;s probably too much to expect even 342 people to maintain one machine a piece. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Avoiding lost time by simply not having it often costs more money than it saves. Patches, especially those for operating systems and virus protection, are written to solve security issues. Since some people are constantly finding new ways to break in to your network, other people are constantly working to keep those intruders out. Their work is distributed as a patch. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Sign up for patch management from ABSS NetSecure. Every machine gets kept up-to-date. You avoid lost time because we do all the work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Vulnerability Testing and Assessment </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Threats come from outside and inside your network. Even if you have a firewall and patch management in place, you are constantly visible to intruders. They may not be able to get in at this moment, but they&rsquo;re always looking toward the next. This means it&rsquo;s good practice to test your security at regular intervals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Firewalls only work as well as they&rsquo;re configured. That configuration must be updated to keep up with emerging threats. One update might be a simple change to one setting. But if your administrator allows incomplete updates to stack up, they&rsquo;ll end up with a complicated task in </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">a short period of time. If that administrator is replaced and leaves no documentation, the new person may not even know where to start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Entrust our ABSS NetSecure professionals to test your firewall configuration for vulnerabilities and advise or implement a solution if they are found. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Inside threats are different. They often get placed when someone finds a way to get them through the firewall. Malicious software can sit dormant for days or months and then activate on command. The key to preventing an outbreak throughout the network, or even a little data stream from heading out into the world, is containment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to spot dormant threats (they are often stealthy by design). Fortunately, our tests confirm that when they become active, they won&rsquo;t be allowed to go anywhere. Our efficiency allows us to test every machine on your network while your people continue to work. When a threat comes to life, it will open its eyes to an impenetrable cage. After that, if you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll spot it with ABSS ClearView and take it out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 19:45:23','2012-02-28 19:45:23','2012-02-28 19:45:23'),(68,24,'en','Offsite Data Backup with DataVault','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\">Offsite Data Backup with DataVault</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your data is the lifeblood of your business. If you lose too much of it, your company may die. We know this sounds harsh and maybe a little dramatic, but there are not many other ways to say it. Fortunately, we have an comparatively light-hearted solution: Data backup with DataVault by ABSS Computer Networks. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Some data loss can&rsquo;t be helped </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve ever accidentally deleted a file, it was exactly that - an accident. The same goes for dumping liquids into your computer. You have some control over this, but if you work long enough, these things just happen. Same goes for hard drive failure. It&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be helped. After a while, they just give up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Save all the data you can </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">First off, make sure you have local, onsite backups. If you need help setting this up, let us know. Every workstation and server that sees action on a daily basis should be backed-up every day (or even every hour if the work load is heavy). There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the relief that comes from retrieving a file that was accidentally erased two hours before (especially if that file took three hours to make). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Back up the most important data safely and securely </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">When it comes to critical information, even the best onsite backups can not protect you<br /> from things like theft, fire, or floods. Store your sensitive data in a vault - a DataVault from ABSS. They&rsquo;re located around the world. This means we keep backups of your backups. Our encryption is military grade - you are the only one who can access your data. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Restore data from anywhere at any time </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s surprising how often files manage to disappear or become corrupt at inconvenient hours. Trouble has no issues with striking at 3:42 am or when you&rsquo;re away on vacation (or both, come to think of it). Now you can retrieve backups from anywhere as long as you have internet access and your security key. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Easy setup and efficient operation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Gone are the days of making room and taking time to setup special, bulky hardware. Your ABSS DataVault has no footprint and can be setup up in minutes. Once the initial backup has been made, the rest can be incremental. Only the changes get saved and the draw on your network is nearly undetectable. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your data </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: &lt;cms:phone /&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 19:46:10','2012-02-28 19:46:10','2012-02-28 19:46:10'),(69,15,'en','Why Choose ABSS Networks?','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\">Nine reasons your business should use ABSS Computer Networks In-Sourced IT</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s likely that there are more than 2,832,371 reasons to use In-Sourced IT.

You might have a person or two that&rsquo;s handy with a wrench and torch, but in the grand scheme of things, those people are more valuable when they are doing what they were hired to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The same scenario applies to your office network. Your camera people may be technologically inclined, but they are probably best suited to developing new CCDs rather than programming firewalls. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our business is taking care of your network.

They may think, as they do with their other responsibilities, that maintaining the network will be a rewarding challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The trouble arises when the challenge goes beyond their abilities. It takes uncommon mental fortitude to swallow and digest the difficult problems. It&rsquo;s not that your person lacks the hunger. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not prepared to consume IT work in the same portions as the job for which they were hired. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Feed us your IT work.

They&rsquo;ll write programs that target indiscriminately. They&rsquo;ll set up scripts that tirelessly chip away at your passwords. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">One day they&rsquo;ll get through and your data will be compromised.<br /> If you have nothing to hide, intrusions are still disasters waiting to happen.<br /> If you have something to hide, like customer data, intrusions are lawsuits waiting to happen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Hardware Firewalls </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep malicious content from entering or leaving your network. Once it gets in, it often takes hold and starts sending sensitive material out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve got anything worth protecting, running without security has a horrible risk/reward ratio. You are risking everything for a reward of nothing. Turn the tables with one easy step. Add a hardware firewall and lock down your data. Change the ratio so you can risk nothing to keep everything. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call ABSS at ###-###-#### to put your data behind the firewall and keep it safe. It&rsquo;s simple to do and it just makes good sense. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Patch Management </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Updating operating systems, virus protection, and software on one machine is mildly time- consuming at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 342 machines, it&rsquo;s certainly too much for one person to maintain all of them. It&rsquo;s probably too much to expect even 342 people to maintain one machine a piece. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Avoiding lost time by simply not having it often costs more money than it saves. Patches, especially those for operating systems and virus protection, are written to solve security issues. Since some people are constantly finding new ways to break in to your network, other people are constantly working to keep those intruders out. Their work is distributed as a patch. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Sign up for patch management from ABSS NetSecure. Every machine gets kept up-to-date. You avoid lost time because we do all the work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Vulnerability Testing and Assessment </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Threats come from outside and inside your network. Even if you have a firewall and patch management in place, you are constantly visible to intruders. They may not be able to get in at this moment, but they&rsquo;re always looking toward the next. This means it&rsquo;s good practice to test your security at regular intervals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Firewalls only work as well as they&rsquo;re configured. That configuration must be updated to keep up with emerging threats. One update might be a simple change to one setting. But if your administrator allows incomplete updates to stack up, they&rsquo;ll end up with a complicated task in </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">a short period of time. If that administrator is replaced and leaves no documentation, the new person may not even know where to start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Entrust our ABSS NetSecure professionals to test your firewall configuration for vulnerabilities and advise or implement a solution if they are found. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Inside threats are different. They often get placed when someone finds a way to get them through the firewall. Malicious software can sit dormant for days or months and then activate on command. The key to preventing an outbreak throughout the network, or even a little data stream from heading out into the world, is containment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to spot dormant threats (they are often stealthy by design). Fortunately, our tests confirm that when they become active, they won&rsquo;t be allowed to go anywhere. Our efficiency allows us to test every machine on your network while your people continue to work. When a threat comes to life, it will open its eyes to an impenetrable cage. After that, if you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll spot it with ABSS ClearView and take it out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: &lt;cms:phone /&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-02-28 21:32:24','2012-02-28 21:32:24','2012-02-28 21:32:24'),(72,27,'en','Contact','<p>Contact ABSS Computer Networks</p>\r\n<p>&lt;cms:form id=\"contact\" /&gt;</p>','1','2012-02-28 21:50:23','2012-02-28 21:50:23','2012-02-28 21:50:23'),(73,28,'en','Services','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-02-28 23:29:46','2012-02-28 23:29:46','2012-02-28 23:29:46'),(74,28,'en','Services','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-02-28 23:31:14','2012-02-28 23:31:14','2012-02-28 23:31:14'),(75,28,'en','Services','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-02-28 23:31:26','2012-02-28 23:31:26','2012-02-28 23:31:26'),(76,26,'en','About ABSS Computer Networks','<p>About Content Here</p>','1','2012-03-05 19:57:08','2012-03-05 19:57:08','2012-03-05 19:57:08'),(77,28,'en','Services Provided','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-03-05 19:58:04','2012-03-05 19:58:04','2012-03-05 19:58:04'),(78,25,'en','Who We Can Help','<h1>Solutions for Any Situation</h1>\r\n<p>ABSS Computer Networks is dedicated to providing you with excellent service in any scenario.</p>','1','2012-03-05 19:58:36','2012-03-05 19:58:36','2012-03-05 19:58:36'),(79,25,'en','Who We Help','<h1>Solutions for Any Situation</h1>\r\n<p>ABSS Computer Networks is dedicated to providing you with excellent service in any scenario.</p>','1','2012-03-05 19:58:53','2012-03-05 19:58:53','2012-03-05 19:58:53'),(80,28,'en','Services Provided','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-03-05 19:59:04','2012-03-05 19:59:04','2012-03-05 19:59:04'),(81,28,'en','Services Provided','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-03-05 19:59:21','2012-03-05 19:59:21','2012-03-05 19:59:21'),(82,27,'en','Contact Us','<p>Contact ABSS Computer Networks</p>\r\n<p>&lt;cms:form id=\"contact\" /&gt;</p>','1','2012-03-05 19:59:35','2012-03-05 19:59:35','2012-03-05 19:59:35'),(83,25,'en','Who We Help','<h1>Solutions for Any Situation</h1>\r\n<p>ABSS Computer Networks is dedicated to providing you with excellent service in any scenario.</p>','1','2012-03-05 20:09:19','2012-03-05 20:09:19','2012-03-05 20:09:19'),(84,15,'en','Why Choose ABSS Networks?','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\">Nine reasons your business should use ABSS Computer Networks In-Sourced IT</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s likely that there are more than 2,832,371 reasons to use In-Sourced IT. Most of them relate to the nine listed here. If even one of these applies to you, please contact us today. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">You are not in the business of IT. </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Look at it this way: If your company designs and builds, say, digital cameras, it&rsquo;s unlikely your employees would get involved in replacing the plumbing in your building. You might have a person or two that&rsquo;s handy with a wrench and torch, but in the grand scheme of things, those people are more valuable when they are doing what they were hired to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The same scenario applies to your office network. Your camera people may be technologically inclined, but they are probably best suited to developing new CCDs rather than programming firewalls. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our business is taking care of your network. Put us to work.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">In-house professionals are expensive </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Full time IT experts are worth their weight in gold. Yes. We are sounding our own horn here, but we believe in what we do. We give you our best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The thing is, even if you are experiencing major network problems, you probably do not need one of us in your office every hour of every day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your solution is to sign with ABSS for In-Sourced and Managed IT.

This is about employees that care about the company and do their best. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Every so often, even your most dedicated people will bite off more than they can chew. They may think, as they do with their other responsibilities, that maintaining the network will be a rewarding challenge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The trouble arises when the challenge goes beyond their abilities. It takes uncommon mental fortitude to swallow and digest the difficult problems. It&rsquo;s not that your person lacks the hunger. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not prepared to consume IT work in the same portions as the job for which they were hired. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Feed us your IT work.

Bring ABSS Computer Networks in as your expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s only natural that as technology marches on, dedicated employees with a full plate of work can have trouble keeping up.

Could be you have a flat ethernet network with 524 end-users and a few server farms. The network performance is poor from time to time and you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve asked your in-house IT to do analysis and possibly redesign the current infrastructure to improve performance. Your employee is top-notch and usually takes any problem and<br /> just handles it. This time, however, the initial response to your request was an expression of excitement that slowly degenerated into abject terror. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your IT experts have not kept up with technology. They&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Of course this scenario is quite a bit better than having an under-qualified, over-confident staff member just diving in and hoping they can swim. It takes training, experience, and life-long learning to avoid drowning in an ocean of routers, cables, switches, and CPUs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">This is another reason we&rsquo;re here &ndash; to be your IT expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe your network slow-down problem stems from too many data collisions.

After all, if it isn&rsquo;t making crunchy grinding noises, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;likely&rdquo; doing just fine. Banking on &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is similar to rolling the dice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you could see inside, things might look a little clearer (and you won&rsquo;t have to gamble). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our ClearView monitoring lets us do exactly that.

It&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be helped. After a while, they just give up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Save all the data you can </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">First off, make sure you have local, onsite backups. If you need help setting this up, let us know. Every workstation and server that sees action on a daily basis should be backed-up every day (or even every hour if the work load is heavy). There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the relief that comes from retrieving a file that was accidentally erased two hours before (especially if that file took three hours to make). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Back up the most important data safely and securely </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">When it comes to critical information, even the best onsite backups can not protect you<br /> from things like theft, fire, or floods. Store your sensitive data in a vault - a DataVault from ABSS. They&rsquo;re located around the world. This means we keep backups of your backups. Our encryption is military grade - you are the only one who can access your data. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Restore data from anywhere at any time </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">It&rsquo;s surprising how often files manage to disappear or become corrupt at inconvenient hours. Trouble has no issues with striking at 3:42 am or when you&rsquo;re away on vacation (or both, come to think of it). Now you can retrieve backups from anywhere as long as you have internet access and your security key. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Easy setup and efficient operation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Gone are the days of making room and taking time to setup special, bulky hardware. Your ABSS DataVault has no footprint and can be setup up in minutes. Once the initial backup has been made, the rest can be incremental. Only the changes get saved and the draw on your network is nearly undetectable. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your data </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: &lt;cms:phone /&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-03-10 22:06:01','2012-03-10 22:06:01','2012-03-10 22:06:01'),(91,21,'en','Network Design by ABSS','<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\"><img style=\"float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"../../../../app/assets/images/sitting-laptop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" />Network Design by ABSS Networks, Inc.</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Since you are reading this, we&rsquo;re willing to bet your business is expanding and it&rsquo;s time to build a new computer network. It&rsquo;s an advantageous position for sure. You&rsquo;ve increased your income and can now increase your efficiency to match. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Eliminate your troubles when it comes to finding the best network design for your company. If you&rsquo;re in the business of Education, Healthcare, Finance, (or anything else, really), there&rsquo;s no reason </span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic;\">you </span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">need to decide on using Bus, Ring, Tree, Star, or Mesh Topology. Leave that decision, and others like it, to the experts at ABSS. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Talk to us about a network that&rsquo;s sized right and does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Scalable Networks </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Large-sized, small-sized, and, well, let&rsquo;s just call them &ldquo;all-sized&rdquo; - we&rsquo;ll create one that works for your company today, tomorrow, and years from now. Take advantage of this fresh start with a network that can grow and shrink with your needs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Order a scalable system from ABSS. Then, when it&rsquo;s time to add a machine for one person or twenty three for an entire team, the expansion can often take place in a day or less. The same goes for contractions (like the sale of a successful business unit). Your sold equipment can be quickly disconnected without compromising network function and integrity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call today. We&rsquo;ll meet with you and discuss what you want to get done. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Routers, switches, modems, and more </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The number of components that make a fully functioning network can boggle the mind. It gets worse once you discover how many of them need to be connected, configured, and, for lack of a better term, convinced to do their job. Make things better for yourself by letting us cover the details. It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re good at. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Wireless networking </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Opening your network to the air can be a convenience dream and security nightmare all at the same time. It&rsquo;s easy to sleep blissfully knowing that a new computer can see the network from anywhere in your building. It&rsquo;s also easy to get jarred awake by the thought of someone parking outside and breaking in with a laptop. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Put your concerns to bed with wireless network design by ABSS Computer Networks. We&rsquo;ll cover the basics (like putting the access point in a place where all devices can see it) and the specifics (like making sure that your settings are configured to keep unwanted users out). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Server recommendation, configuration, and installation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Trust us to suggest a machine that&rsquo;s more than enough to do the job and yet not excessive. Maybe one computer is enough. Maybe you&rsquo;ll need a group of them to balance the load. Maybe </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">you could benefit from virtual machines. No matter what, we&rsquo;ll look at your goal and build, configure, and install a server (or servers) that will accomplish it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Workstation recommendation, configuration, and installation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">We&rsquo;ll take into account what you and your employees will do at your desks and specify machines that fit your demands. It&rsquo;s likely those machines won&rsquo;t be one-size-fits-all. We&rsquo;ll use our expertise to build workstations that can do just a bit more than they&rsquo;re supposed to. That way you won&rsquo;t need to upgrade quite so soon. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Configure and install network printers </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Most days it&rsquo;s easy to print. Just put what you want on the screen, and, well, select print. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to add a printer and make it visible to everyone, you might already understand why we offer this service. If there was ever one type of device that hates to play nice, this would be it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Onsite data backup and recovery </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Now that we&rsquo;ve got a network for your data to move about, let us help keep you from losing it. We can configure onsite data storage and automatic backup. Rest assured that if a hard drive fails in spectacular fashion or someone accidentally deletes a file with a whimper, you&rsquo;ll be able to retrieve your latest backup in minutes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Remember that even the best onsite systems can&rsquo;t protect data from disaster. Fires, floods and earthquakes don&rsquo;t seem to discriminate when it comes to destruction of property. Look into our offsite backup service to protect your most sensitive data in secure locations around the globe. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Point-of-failure elimination with redundancy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Seems like no matter what you do, something just breaks without warning. Maybe a power supply gets tired and pops or a hard drive just kinda wheezes and clunks to a halt. Usually our network monitoring service spots an anomaly before it turns into a failure. But every once in a while a machine will just give up the ghost without so much as flicker of notice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks are designed with redundancy in mind. If a critical portion of the network stops working, other machines step in to take up the slack.You&rsquo;ll likely feel it in the form of a slow-down here or there, but our monitoring will tell us immediately that something is up (or down as the case may be).<br /> If you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll know what to bring before you even call for service. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and get a new network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-03-10 22:06:49','2012-03-10 22:06:49','2012-03-10 22:06:49'),(92,22,'en','Network Security with ABSS NetSecure','<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\"><img style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; float: right;\" src=\"../../../../app/assets/images/sitting-laptop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" />Network Security with ABSS NetSecure</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you\'ve been in business long enough, you\'ll likely agree that people will try to hack your network, you know, just because. They&rsquo;ll write programs that target indiscriminately. They&rsquo;ll set up scripts that tirelessly chip away at your passwords. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">One day they&rsquo;ll get through and your data will be compromised.<br /> If you have nothing to hide, intrusions are still disasters waiting to happen.<br /> If you have something to hide, like customer data, intrusions are lawsuits waiting to happen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Hardware Firewalls </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep malicious content from entering or leaving your network. Once it gets in, it often takes hold and starts sending sensitive material out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve got anything worth protecting, running without security has a horrible risk/reward ratio. You are risking everything for a reward of nothing. Turn the tables with one easy step. Add a hardware firewall and lock down your data. Change the ratio so you can risk nothing to keep everything. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call ABSS at ###-###-#### to put your data behind the firewall and keep it safe. It&rsquo;s simple to do and it just makes good sense. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Patch Management </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Updating operating systems, virus protection, and software on one machine is mildly time- consuming at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 342 machines, it&rsquo;s certainly too much for one person to maintain all of them. It&rsquo;s probably too much to expect even 342 people to maintain one machine a piece. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Avoiding lost time by simply not having it often costs more money than it saves. Patches, especially those for operating systems and virus protection, are written to solve security issues. Since some people are constantly finding new ways to break in to your network, other people are constantly working to keep those intruders out. Their work is distributed as a patch. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Sign up for patch management from ABSS NetSecure. Every machine gets kept up-to-date. You avoid lost time because we do all the work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Vulnerability Testing and Assessment </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Threats come from outside and inside your network. Even if you have a firewall and patch management in place, you are constantly visible to intruders. They may not be able to get in at this moment, but they&rsquo;re always looking toward the next. This means it&rsquo;s good practice to test your security at regular intervals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Firewalls only work as well as they&rsquo;re configured. That configuration must be updated to keep up with emerging threats. One update might be a simple change to one setting. But if your administrator allows incomplete updates to stack up, they&rsquo;ll end up with a complicated task in </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">a short period of time. If that administrator is replaced and leaves no documentation, the new person may not even know where to start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Entrust our ABSS NetSecure professionals to test your firewall configuration for vulnerabilities and advise or implement a solution if they are found. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Inside threats are different. They often get placed when someone finds a way to get them through the firewall. Malicious software can sit dormant for days or months and then activate on command. The key to preventing an outbreak throughout the network, or even a little data stream from heading out into the world, is containment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to spot dormant threats (they are often stealthy by design). Fortunately, our tests confirm that when they become active, they won&rsquo;t be allowed to go anywhere. Our efficiency allows us to test every machine on your network while your people continue to work. When a threat comes to life, it will open its eyes to an impenetrable cage. After that, if you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll spot it with ABSS ClearView and take it out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: &lt;cms:phone /&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-03-10 22:07:04','2012-03-10 22:07:04','2012-03-10 22:07:04'),(93,13,'en','Home','<p>Our mission is simple.

It could be you are here because you need help with an existing system. Maybe you know it&rsquo;s time to put in a new network. Or it could be a combination of both. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Not only are we the premier choice for your IT needs, we have the specific experience needed to understand your school&rsquo;s best interests. Our work with the Boys Republic of Chino, Somerset Educational Services, and other local boarding schools has given us the edge needed to serve you. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Security and privacy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You\'re likely aware how important is to protect the personal information of students enrolled&nbsp;at your institution. We\'re right there with you on that. Work with our experts to lock down&nbsp;your records with ABSS NetSecure. We do it with sophisticated hardware firewalls that keep malicious content from getting in or out. We do it with patch management on every component in your network. We do it with vulnerability testing and assessment conducted by our experts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Migrate to Mac computer networks </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Apple has long been at the forefront when it comes to computerizing education. If you\'re looking to replace part or all of your Windows-based network with machines that run the Mac OS, you\'re in the right place. Talk to us about network design. Have us assemble a configuration that does exactly what you want it to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Integrate Mac and Windows machines into one efficient network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If administration is running fine on Windows-based PCs and the teachers and students are working away in a separate Mac network, you may think it best to leave well enough alone. The thing is, when you stay this course, you lose efficiency and the ability to communicate with classrooms and monitor their activity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Integrate your networks with help from ABSS.

The amount of time people spend looking at social and pornographic websites is staggering. We\'re willing to bet you have Facebook open in another window or tab right now. Don\'t be surprised if we\'re right. One of every twelve people on the planet has a Facebook account. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Eliminate the tremendous temptation to see what friends are saying and protect your organization from legal action with content filtering. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Data backup and restoration</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Work with us to save every bit of student record data you can.

It&rsquo;s an advantageous position for sure. You&rsquo;ve increased your income and can now increase your efficiency to match. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Eliminate your troubles when it comes to finding the best network design for your company. If you&rsquo;re in the business of Education, Healthcare, Finance, (or anything else, really), there&rsquo;s no reason </span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic;\">you </span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">need to decide on using Bus, Ring, Tree, Star, or Mesh Topology. Leave that decision, and others like it, to the experts at ABSS. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Talk to us about a network that&rsquo;s sized right and does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Scalable Networks </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Large-sized, small-sized, and, well, let&rsquo;s just call them &ldquo;all-sized&rdquo; - we&rsquo;ll create one that works for your company today, tomorrow, and years from now. Take advantage of this fresh start with a network that can grow and shrink with your needs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Order a scalable system from ABSS. Then, when it&rsquo;s time to add a machine for one person or twenty three for an entire team, the expansion can often take place in a day or less. The same goes for contractions (like the sale of a successful business unit). Your sold equipment can be quickly disconnected without compromising network function and integrity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call today. We&rsquo;ll meet with you and discuss what you want to get done. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Routers, switches, modems, and more </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">The number of components that make a fully functioning network can boggle the mind. It gets worse once you discover how many of them need to be connected, configured, and, for lack of a better term, convinced to do their job. Make things better for yourself by letting us cover the details. It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re good at. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Wireless networking </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Opening your network to the air can be a convenience dream and security nightmare all at the same time. It&rsquo;s easy to sleep blissfully knowing that a new computer can see the network from anywhere in your building. It&rsquo;s also easy to get jarred awake by the thought of someone parking outside and breaking in with a laptop. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Put your concerns to bed with wireless network design by ABSS Computer Networks. We&rsquo;ll cover the basics (like putting the access point in a place where all devices can see it) and the specifics (like making sure that your settings are configured to keep unwanted users out). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Server recommendation, configuration, and installation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Trust us to suggest a machine that&rsquo;s more than enough to do the job and yet not excessive.

It&rsquo;s likely those machines won&rsquo;t be one-size-fits-all. We&rsquo;ll use our expertise to build workstations that can do just a bit more than they&rsquo;re supposed to. That way you won&rsquo;t need to upgrade quite so soon. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Configure and install network printers </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Most days it&rsquo;s easy to print. Just put what you want on the screen, and, well, select print. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to add a printer and make it visible to everyone, you might already understand why we offer this service. If there was ever one type of device that hates to play nice, this would be it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Onsite data backup and recovery </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Now that we&rsquo;ve got a network for your data to move about, let us help keep you from losing it. We can configure onsite data storage and automatic backup. Rest assured that if a hard drive fails in spectacular fashion or someone accidentally deletes a file with a whimper, you&rsquo;ll be able to retrieve your latest backup in minutes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Remember that even the best onsite systems can&rsquo;t protect data from disaster. Fires, floods and earthquakes don&rsquo;t seem to discriminate when it comes to destruction of property. Look into our offsite backup service to protect your most sensitive data in secure locations around the globe. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Point-of-failure elimination with redundancy </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Seems like no matter what you do, something just breaks without warning. Maybe a power supply gets tired and pops or a hard drive just kinda wheezes and clunks to a halt. Usually our network monitoring service spots an anomaly before it turns into a failure. But every once in a while a machine will just give up the ghost without so much as flicker of notice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks are designed with redundancy in mind. If a critical portion of the network stops working, other machines step in to take up the slack.You&rsquo;ll likely feel it in the form of a slow-down here or there, but our monitoring will tell us immediately that something is up (or down as the case may be).<br /> If you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll know what to bring before you even call for service. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and get a new network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: ###-###-####&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-03-21 22:59:50','2012-03-21 22:59:50','2012-03-21 22:59:50'),(114,28,'en','Services Provided','<h1>Services Provided by ABSS Networks, Inc.</h1>','1','2012-03-21 23:01:01','2012-03-21 23:01:01','2012-03-21 23:01:01'),(115,24,'en','Disaster & Recovery Planning','<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\"><img style=\"float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"../../../../app/assets/images/remove-server.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" />Disaster &amp; Recovery Planning</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your data is the lifeblood of your business.

If you need help setting this up, let us know. Every workstation and server that sees action on a daily basis should be backed-up every day (or even every hour if the work load is heavy).

Trouble has no issues with striking at 3:42 am or when you&rsquo;re away on vacation (or both, come to think of it). Now you can retrieve backups from anywhere as long as you have internet access and your security key. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Easy setup and efficient operation </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Gone are the days of making room and taking time to setup special, bulky hardware.

They&rsquo;ll write programs that target indiscriminately. They&rsquo;ll set up scripts that tirelessly chip away at your passwords. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">One day they&rsquo;ll get through and your data will be compromised.<br /> If you have nothing to hide, intrusions are still disasters waiting to happen.<br /> If you have something to hide, like customer data, intrusions are lawsuits waiting to happen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Hardware Firewalls </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Keep malicious content from entering or leaving your network. Once it gets in, it often takes hold and starts sending sensitive material out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you&rsquo;ve got anything worth protecting, running without security has a horrible risk/reward ratio. You are risking everything for a reward of nothing. Turn the tables with one easy step. Add a hardware firewall and lock down your data. Change the ratio so you can risk nothing to keep everything. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Call ABSS at ###-###-#### to put your data behind the firewall and keep it safe. It&rsquo;s simple to do and it just makes good sense. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Patch Management </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Updating operating systems, virus protection, and software on one machine is mildly time- consuming at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 342 machines, it&rsquo;s certainly too much for one person to maintain all of them. It&rsquo;s probably too much to expect even 342 people to maintain one machine a piece. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Avoiding lost time by simply not having it often costs more money than it saves. Patches, especially those for operating systems and virus protection, are written to solve security issues. Since some people are constantly finding new ways to break in to your network, other people are constantly working to keep those intruders out. Their work is distributed as a patch. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Sign up for patch management from ABSS NetSecure. Every machine gets kept up-to-date. You avoid lost time because we do all the work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Vulnerability Testing and Assessment </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Threats come from outside and inside your network. Even if you have a firewall and patch management in place, you are constantly visible to intruders. They may not be able to get in at this moment, but they&rsquo;re always looking toward the next. This means it&rsquo;s good practice to test your security at regular intervals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Firewalls only work as well as they&rsquo;re configured. That configuration must be updated to keep up with emerging threats. One update might be a simple change to one setting. But if your administrator allows incomplete updates to stack up, they&rsquo;ll end up with a complicated task in </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">a short period of time. If that administrator is replaced and leaves no documentation, the new person may not even know where to start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Entrust our ABSS NetSecure professionals to test your firewall configuration for vulnerabilities and advise or implement a solution if they are found. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Inside threats are different. They often get placed when someone finds a way to get them through the firewall. Malicious software can sit dormant for days or months and then activate on command. The key to preventing an outbreak throughout the network, or even a little data stream from heading out into the world, is containment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to spot dormant threats (they are often stealthy by design). Fortunately, our tests confirm that when they become active, they won&rsquo;t be allowed to go anywhere. Our efficiency allows us to test every machine on your network while your people continue to work. When a threat comes to life, it will open its eyes to an impenetrable cage. After that, if you&rsquo;ve signed up for Managed IT, we&rsquo;ll spot it with ABSS ClearView and take it out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Call today and protect your network </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">ABSS Computer Networks: &lt;cms:phone /&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','1','2012-03-21 23:05:14','2012-03-21 23:05:14','2012-03-21 23:05:14'),(119,31,'en','DataCenter Hosting','<h1>DataCenter Hosting</h1>','1','2012-03-21 23:06:34','2012-03-21 23:06:34','2012-03-21 23:06:34'),(120,31,'en','DataCenter Hosting','<h1>DataCenter Hosting</h1>\r\n<p>Content Needed</p>','1','2012-03-21 23:06:50','2012-03-21 23:06:50','2012-03-21 23:06:50'),(121,20,'en','Managed & Field IT Services','<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<h1 class=\"section\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;\"><img style=\"float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"../../../../app/assets/images/man-rack.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Managed IT</span></h1>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All the network services you need organized into levels that fit your business.

After all, if it isn&rsquo;t making crunchy grinding noises, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;likely&rdquo; doing just fine. Banking on &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is similar to rolling the dice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you could see inside, things might look a little clearer (and you won&rsquo;t have to gamble). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our ClearView monitoring lets us do exactly that. It&rsquo;s a window to the inner workings of your network. With it we can: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Communicate with a secure, invisible connection</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All transmissions to and from your network are encrypted via SSL.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">The monitoring agent uses almost no system resources. You will not see any&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">network slow-downs.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Manage and monitor Servers, Networks and Workstations</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Choose the plan that&rsquo;s right for you. We can cover one server or an entire network</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Find problems before they happen</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">ClearView checks the operation of your equipment against known baselines.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Hardware failure is usually preceded by small changes in operation. We get&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">notified the instant that happens.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Fix many problems without coming in</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">ClearView and our Managed IT service includes remote repair when possible. Most remote services don&rsquo;t need a person on your end at all.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Keep antivirus up-to-date on all your machines</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">It&rsquo;s not likely that all your employees think to maintain their own machines.

This is the sort of thing we handle in minutes. All you need to do is request it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe an employee forgot a password and entered the wrong one too many times. They&rsquo;re locked out of their own machine and can not get any work done. We can resolve this during office hours with one quick phone call. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All our levels of service include some amount of this kind of help. We&rsquo;re like that tech-savvy friend that so many people have. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Come to think of it, we&rsquo;re also a friend of that friend. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">We&rsquo;re the Expert&rsquo;s Expert when you need one </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting (or complicated, if you&rsquo;re not a computer person at heart). Could be you have a flat ethernet network with 524 end-users and a few server farms. The network performance is poor from time to time and you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve asked your in-house IT to do analysis and possibly redesign the current infrastructure to improve performance. Your employee is top-notch and usually takes any problem and<br /> just handles it. This time, however, the initial response to your request was an expression of excitement that slowly degenerated into abject terror. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your IT experts have not kept up with technology. They&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Of course this scenario is quite a bit better than having an under-qualified, over-confident staff member just diving in and hoping they can swim. It takes training, experience, and life-long learning to avoid drowning in an ocean of routers, cables, switches, and CPUs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">This is another reason we&rsquo;re here &ndash; to be your IT expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe your network slow-down problem stems from too many data collisions. It&rsquo;s possible that segmentation is the answer. We need to start by taking a look inside. The best thing to do right now is call us at ###-###-#### to find out for sure. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Levels of Service </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt;

After all, if it isn&rsquo;t making crunchy grinding noises, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;likely&rdquo; doing just fine. Banking on &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is similar to rolling the dice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">If you could see inside, things might look a little clearer (and you won&rsquo;t have to gamble). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Our ClearView monitoring lets us do exactly that. It&rsquo;s a window to the inner workings of your network. With it we can: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Communicate with a secure, invisible connection</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All transmissions to and from your network are encrypted via SSL.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">The monitoring agent uses almost no system resources. You will not see any&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">network slow-downs.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Manage and monitor Servers, Networks and Workstations</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Choose the plan that&rsquo;s right for you.

We get&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">notified the instant that happens.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">Fix many problems without coming in</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;\">ClearView and our Managed IT service includes remote repair when possible.

This is the sort of thing we handle in minutes. All you need to do is request it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe an employee forgot a password and entered the wrong one too many times. They&rsquo;re locked out of their own machine and can not get any work done. We can resolve this during office hours with one quick phone call. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">All our levels of service include some amount of this kind of help. We&rsquo;re like that tech-savvy friend that so many people have. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Come to think of it, we&rsquo;re also a friend of that friend. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">We&rsquo;re the Expert&rsquo;s Expert when you need one </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting (or complicated, if you&rsquo;re not a computer person at heart). Could be you have a flat ethernet network with 524 end-users and a few server farms. The network performance is poor from time to time and you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">You&rsquo;ve asked your in-house IT to do analysis and possibly redesign the current infrastructure to improve performance. Your employee is top-notch and usually takes any problem and<br /> just handles it. This time, however, the initial response to your request was an expression of excitement that slowly degenerated into abject terror. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Your IT experts have not kept up with technology. They&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Of course this scenario is quite a bit better than having an under-qualified, over-confident staff member just diving in and hoping they can swim. It takes training, experience, and life-long learning to avoid drowning in an ocean of routers, cables, switches, and CPUs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">This is another reason we&rsquo;re here &ndash; to be your IT expert&rsquo;s expert. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\';\">Maybe your network slow-down problem stems from too many data collisions. It&rsquo;s possible that segmentation is the answer. We need to start by taking a look inside. The best thing to do right now is call us at ###-###-#### to find out for sure. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: bold;\">Levels of Service </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt;
